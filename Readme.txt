!Fortran project: a model for the steady state 1-D shallow water equations
!This script will calculate the Steady state of 1D shallow Water Depth, Bed elevation and velocity based on different ODE scheme (Eular, RK2 and RK4)
!For selecting different scheme please change the value of ODE in the input file, (USE 1 for Euler, 2 for Runga Kutta 2nd order and 4 for Runga Kutta 4th order)
!Also change the value of dx in the input file for correspoding analytical solution
